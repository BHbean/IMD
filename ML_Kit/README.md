# MLKit Samples

 A collection of [quickstart samples](https://github.com/googlesamples/mlkit) demonstrating the [ML Kit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit) APIs on Android and iOS.

 ## ML Kit Vision Quickstart
  
 This [ML Kit Quickstart](https://github.com/googlesamples/mlkit/tree/master/android/vision-quickstart) app demonstrates how to use and integrate various vision based ML Kit features into your app.

- [Object Detection](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/object-detection/android) - Detect, track, and classify objects in real time and static images
- [Face Detection](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/face-detection/android) - Detect faces in real time and static images
- [Text Recognition](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/text-recognition/android) - Recognize text in real time and static images
- [Barcode Scanning](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/barcode-scanning/android) - Scan barcodes in real time and static images
- [Image Labeling](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/image-labeling/android) - Label images in real time and static images
- [Custom Image Labeling](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/image-labeling/custom-models/android) - Birds - Label images of birds with a custom TensorFlow Lite model.
- [Pose Detection](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/pose-detection/android) - Detect the position of the human body in real time.

 ## Natrual Language
 - [Language Identification](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/language/identification) - With ML Kit's on-device language identification API, you can determine the language of a string of text.
 - [Translation](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/language/translation) - With ML Kit's on-device Translation API, you can dynamically translate text between more than 50 languages.
 - [Smart Reply](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/language/smart-reply) - With ML Kit's Smart Reply API, you can automatically generate relevant replies to messages. Smart Reply helps your users respond to messages quickly, and makes it easier to reply to messages on devices with limited input capabilities.
